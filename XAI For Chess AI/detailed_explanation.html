                <h2>Feature Meanings</h2>
                <p><b>Material Advantage:</b> The value of the pieces on the board, considering captures and losses.</p>
                <p><b>Center Control:</b> Control over the central squares of the board, which is crucial for overall board dominance.</p>
                <p><b>King Safety:</b> The safety of the king, including factors like castling and piece placement around the king.</p>
                <p><b>Mobility:</b> The number of valid moves available, reflecting the flexibility and potential of pieces.</p>
                <p><b>Attack Coverage:</b> The number of squares controlled or attacked, putting pressure on the opponent's pieces.</p>
                <p><b>Defense Stance:</b> The defensive positioning of pieces, protecting against threats and securing key positions.</p>

        <h2>Score Calculation Formula</h2>
        <p>The score for each move is calculated using the following formula:</p>
        <p> <b>Score</b> = <br>
          &emsp;&emsp;  0.0105383472316387 * Material Advantage +<br>  &emsp;&emsp;  1.7177645298337515e-06 * Center Control +<br>  &emsp;&emsp;  1.464427617159951e-06 * King Safety +<br>  &emsp;&emsp;  0.9894549589630592 * Mobility +<br>  &emsp;&emsp;  1.5908193050449293e-06 * Attack Coverage +<br>  &emsp;&emsp;  1.920793850048416e-06 * Defense Stance </p>
                <h2>Current Feature Values</h2>
                <p><b>Chosen Move Feature Values:</b> Material Advantage: 0.00, Center Control: 4.00, King Safety: 30.00, Mobility: 22.00, Attack Coverage: 22.00, Defense Stance: 0.00</p>
                <p><b>Best Move Feature Values:</b> Material Advantage: 0.00, Center Control: -7.00, King Safety: 30.00, Mobility: 24.00, Attack Coverage: -24.00, Defense Stance: 14.00</p>
                <h2>Formulas Used</h2>
                <p><b>For Chosen AI move:</b> feature_diff = chosen_move_features - best_features</p>
                <p><b>For Comparison:</b> feature_diff = comparison_move_features - chosen_move_features</p>
